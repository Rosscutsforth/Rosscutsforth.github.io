  <p class="experience_paragraph">I have been working on a few websites as personal
  projects but have yet to accrue any job experience
  building websites. I'm currently enrolled at <b>General
  Assembly</b> and hope to learn the skills to make myself
  into a talented and efficient web developer! I love to code, as
  I'm currently teaching myself HTML, CSS, C#, and the basics of
  Unity. I also enjoy reading, writing, playing video games, and
  recreational sports.</p>
